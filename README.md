# PenDrop: A Personal SwiftUI Focus Timer with Water Wave

PenDrop is a personal iOS project developed using SwiftUI, implementing a visually unique Pomodoro-style focus timer. It features a dynamic animated water wave that intuitively displays session progress, built as a hands-on exercise in modern iOS UI development. This project serves as a demonstration of SwiftUI concepts and building custom UI elements.

## Project Purpose

This project was developed primarily for:

* Practicing and deepening skills in SwiftUI.
* Learning to build custom, animated UI components (like the `WaterWaveView`).
* Implementing timer logic and state management in a SwiftUI application using `ObservableObject`.
* Creating a functional personal tool for productivity.

## Features

* **Pomodoro Timer:** Implements the core concept of focused work sessions followed by breaks.
* **Visual Progress Indicator:** Features a custom `WaterWaveView` that animates, filling up as the timer progresses.
* **Configurable Durations:** Settings allow for adjusting work, short break, and long break times.
* **Session Tracking:** Displays the number of completed work sessions.
* **Session Completion View:** A distinct screen is shown when a timer finishes.
* **Timer Controls:** Play, Pause, and Reset actions.
* **Haptic Feedback:** Provides tactile confirmation for button taps.

## Technologies Used

* **Swift**: The core programming language.
* **SwiftUI**: Used for building the entire user interface in a declarative way.
* **Combine**: Integrated with `ObservableObject` in the `TimerViewModel` for state management.

## Note

This project is a personal learning endeavor and is not actively maintained for public use or distribution. The code is shared for demonstration and portfolio purposes.
